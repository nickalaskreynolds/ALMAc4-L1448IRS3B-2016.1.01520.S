This directory is mostly just a placeholder. The .tex files and all supporting files are wildly out-of-date. The file "Reynolds_2021_ApJL_907_L10-2.pdf" is the up-to-date, accepted paper that can be found on arxiv and the APJL publisher.

I performed many updates and changes between collaborators and with the editor offline, thus I don't have the intermediate updates for the paper. Learn from this mistake and use automatic version control software and integrations like overleaf+git or really anything + git.
